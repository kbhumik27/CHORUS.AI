🎵 Music Generator
A generative AI-based music composition tool that creates unique melodies and audio samples using deep learning techniques.

🚀 Features
🎼 Generates music based on learned patterns and features from datasets

🧠 Built on neural audio synthesis techniques

🎛️ Feature-based input control (e.g., pitch, instrument, timbre)

🎧 Supports model training and inference for audio generation

💾 Dataset integration with NSynth, NES-MDB, and custom inputs

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Librosa / Torchaudio

NSynth / NES-MDB datasets

Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)

Streamlit / Gradio (optional UI)

📦 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-generator.git
cd music-generator
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Dataset
This project primarily supports:

NSynth: A large-scale dataset of annotated musical notes

NES-MDB: Multi-instrumental music from NES games with aligned scores and audio

Preprocessing scripts are provided under data/.

🏁 Usage
1. Preprocess Data
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/preprocess_nsynth.py
2. Train the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/train_model.py --dataset nsynth
3. Generate Music
bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/generate.py --model models/latest.pth
4. Listen to Results
Generated audio will be saved in outputs/. You can use any audio player or visualize the waveform using:

python
Copy
Edit
import librosa.display
🧪 Example Output
(Optional: Include audio samples or waveform images here)

💡 Future Work
Integrate MIDI input/output

Real-time generation interface with Streamlit

Genre conditioning and control

Expand to transformer-based music models
