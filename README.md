# 🎵 Music Generator

A generative AI-based music composition tool that creates unique melodies and audio samples using deep learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎼 Generates music based on learned patterns and features from datasets  
- 🧠 Built on neural audio synthesis techniques  
- 🎛️ Feature-based input control (e.g., pitch, instrument, timbre)  
- 🎧 Supports model training and inference for audio generation  
- 💾 Dataset integration with NSynth, NES-MDB, and custom inputs  

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python  
- TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Librosa / Torchaudio  
- NSynth / NES-MDB datasets  
- Jupyter Notebooks (for experimentation)  
- Streamlit / Gradio (optional UI)  

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-generator.git
cd music-generator
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset

This project primarily supports:

- [NSynth](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/nsynth): A large-scale dataset of annotated musical notes  
- [NES-MDB](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/nesmdb): Multi-instrumental music from NES games with aligned scores and audio  

Preprocessing scripts are provided under `data/`.

## 🏁 Usage

### 1. Preprocess Data

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_nsynth.py
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py --dataset nsynth
```

### 3. Generate Music

```bash
python scripts/generate.py --model models/latest.pth
```

### 4. Listen to Results

Generated audio will be saved in `outputs/`. You can use any audio player or visualize the waveform using:

```python
import librosa.display
```

## 🧪 Example Output

> _(Optional: Include audio samples or waveform images here)_

## 💡 Future Work

- Integrate MIDI input/output  
- Real-time generation interface with Streamlit  
- Genre conditioning and control  
- Expand to transformer-based music models
